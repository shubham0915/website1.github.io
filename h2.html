    <h1>Main factors affecting Climate Change</h1>
  </header>

  <main>
    <div class="paragraph">
      <p>Climate change is primarily driven by human activities, with the burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, industrial processes, and agricultural practices releasing greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. These gases trap heat, intensifying the natural greenhouse effect and leading to a rise in global temperatures. Human-induced alterations to land use, coupled with natural factors like volcanic eruptions, contribute to shifts in climate patterns. The consequences encompass rising sea levels, extreme weather events, and ecological disruptions. Tackling climate change necessitates a concerted global effort, emphasizing the transition to renewable energy, sustainable land management, and international collaboration to curb the impact of anthropogenic factors on the Earth's climate.</p>

      <h2 class="h2h2">GLOBAL WARMING</h2>
      <p>Global warming, fueled by human-induced emissions of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, is leading to a sustained increase in Earth's overall temperature. The consequences are profound, manifesting in rising sea levels, more frequent and severe weather events, and ecological imbalances. This crisis results from activities such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes. Addressing global warming necessitates concerted global efforts, emphasizing the transition to renewable energy, heightened energy efficiency, and the preservation of forests. Urgent action is essential to mitigate the impact on vulnerable communities, prevent further ecological degradation, and secure a sustainable future. Heightened awareness and individual responsibility play critical roles in fostering a collective commitment to reduce carbon footprints and mitigate the unfolding consequences of climate change.</p>

      <h2 class="h2h2">GREENHOUSE EFFECT</h2>
      <p>
        The greenhouse effect is a natural process crucial for maintaining Earth's temperature. However, human activities, such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation, intensify this effect by increasing the concentration of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. These gases trap heat, preventing it from escaping into space and leading to a gradual warming of the planet. While the greenhouse effect is essential for life, its augmentation contributes to global warming, climate change, and adverse environmental impacts. Addressing this issue involves sustainable practices, reducing emissions, and transitioning to cleaner energy sources to strike a balance that preserves the delicate equilibrium of Earth's climate system.</p>
